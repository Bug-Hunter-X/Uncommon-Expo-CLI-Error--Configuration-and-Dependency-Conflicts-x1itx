# Uncommon Expo CLI Error: Configuration and Dependency Conflicts

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo CLI. The error stems from inconsistencies in project configuration files (package.json, app.json, eas.json) or conflicts between dependencies.

## Problem
The exact error message varies, but the core issue revolves around mismatched versions or conflicting dependencies leading to unexpected behavior or build failures.  This is distinct from common errors, making diagnosis more challenging.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing and resolving discrepancies in the project's configuration and dependency management. This often requires manual intervention to synchronize versions and address conflicts.

## Reproduction Steps
The example code (expoBug.js and expoBugSolution.js) illustrates how configuration or dependency errors can manifest.  Specific steps depend on the nature of the detected conflict.  You may need to experiment with changing dependency versions or removing conflicting packages to trigger the error.
