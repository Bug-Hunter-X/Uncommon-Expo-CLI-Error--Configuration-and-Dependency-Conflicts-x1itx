This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project, and it usually involves issues with the project's configuration or dependencies.  The exact error message might vary, but it often points to problems in the `package.json`, `app.json`, or `eas.json` files. One common cause is an inconsistency between the versions specified in these files and the actual installed packages or Expo SDK version.
