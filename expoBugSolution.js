The solution involves a methodical approach:

1. **Verify `package.json`:** Check that all dependencies listed in `package.json` are compatible with each other and with the Expo SDK version specified in `app.json` and `eas.json` (if used). Use npm-check-updates or yarn outdated to identify outdated packages.
2. **Resolve Version Conflicts:** If there are conflicting versions, either upgrade all dependent packages to their latest compatible versions or downgrade to a version known to work. 
3. **Clean and Reinstall:**  Run `expo prebuild` followed by `expo start` to clear caches and reinstall dependencies.
4. **Examine `app.json` and `eas.json`:** Ensure that the settings in these files are correct, particularly the Expo SDK version, and that they're consistent with the installed packages.
5. **Check for Typos:** Typos in package names or versions in configuration files are a common source of errors. Carefully review for any such mistakes. 
6. **Inspect Node Modules:** If problems persist, manually remove the `node_modules` directory and reinstall dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
7. **Examine Expo Logs:** Pay close attention to any warning or error messages during build or start. These often provide important clues.

Example (expoBugSolution.js):

```javascript
// ... corrected package.json, app.json, and eas.json ...
// ... corrected or updated dependency versions ...
// ... other corrections based on the specific error ...
expo start; // Start the project after correcting the errors
```
